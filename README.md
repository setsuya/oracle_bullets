# Oracle Bullets
*For lack of a better name =P*

**The project is being hosted [here](https://setsuya.github.io/oracle_bullets) using *Github Pages*.**

### About
The motivation for this project came from me returning to play God Eater Resurrection and looking for good bullets to copy and use myself. It bothered me a bit that people were sharing two different screenshots of the game just to be able to get the whole recipe for the bullet. It looked ugly and sometimes confused me because the images wouldn't "align" and parts of the recipe would appear on both images. And what would happen if one of the image links was broken? Incomplete recipe and sure frustration.

So I decided to start this project where you could create your bullet recipe and use the resulting link to share your creation anywhere you want. It is far from perfect and I am still missing some things I deem *somewhat* important, but it is still very usable as it is right now.

### To-do list:
- [ ] Allow naming the bullet
- [ ] Select which weapon type the bullet is made for
- [ ] Display Oracle cost (for modules as well as for the whole bullet)
- [ ] Filter modules properly
